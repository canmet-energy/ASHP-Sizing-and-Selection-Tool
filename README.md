# ASHP Sizing and Selection Tool

## 📖 What This Tool Does (For Mechanical Engineers)

This Python tool helps **mechanical engineers** size and select **Air Source Heat Pumps (ASHP)** by processing Canadian weather data. It downloads real weather files from across Canada and calculates **heating and cooling degree hours** - the key metrics you need for proper HVAC equipment sizing.

### Why Do You Need This?
- ✅ **Accurate Equipment Sizing**: Get precise heating/cooling loads for any Canadian location
- ✅ **Multiple Design Scenarios**: Compare different operating strategies (6 scenarios included)
- ✅ **Ready-to-Use Data**: Outputs CSV files you can directly use in Excel or other engineering software
- ✅ **Seasonal Analysis**: Understand equipment performance across different seasons
- ✅ **Binned Temperature Data**: See exactly how many hours your equipment will operate at each temperature

## 🏗️ Engineering Background

### What Are Degree Hours?
**Degree hours** measure the cumulative heating or cooling demand over time:
- **Heating Degree Hours (HDH)**: How much heating energy is needed below a threshold temperature
- **Cooling Degree Hours (CDH)**: How much cooling energy is needed above a threshold temperature

### The 6 Analysis Scenarios
This tool processes weather data using 6 predefined scenarios optimized for Canadian climates:

| Scenario | Type | Daily Threshold | Weekly Threshold | Purpose |
|----------|------|----------------|------------------|---------|
| **hdh_sc1** | Heating | 18.3°C | None | Conservative heating design |
| **hdh_sc2** | Heating | 14.9°C | None | Standard heating design |
| **hdh_sc3** | Heating | 14.9°C | 17.1°C | Optimized heating with weekly logic |
| **cdh_sc1** | Cooling | 18.3°C | None | Conservative cooling design |
| **cdh_sc2** | Cooling | 22.8°C | None | Standard cooling design |
| **cdh_sc3** | Cooling | 22.8°C | 19.5°C | Optimized cooling with weekly logic |

### Temperature Binning
Weather data is organized into **2.8°C temperature bins** (e.g., -23.6°C to -20.8°C) so you can see:
- How many hours your equipment operates at each temperature range
- Peak demand periods and typical operating conditions
- Seasonal variations in heating/cooling loads

## 💻 Getting Started (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Get the Code from GitHub

1. **Install Git** (if not already installed):
   - Windows: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
   - Mac: Install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`
   - Linux: `sudo apt install git` (Ubuntu) or `sudo yum install git` (CentOS)

2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ASHP-Sizing-and-Selection-Tool-1.git
   cd ASHP-Sizing-and-Selection-Tool-1
   ```

### Step 2: Set Up Python Environment

1. **Check Python version** (need Python 3.8 or higher):
   ```bash
   python --version
   # or
   python3 --version
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (keeps this project's packages separate):
   ```bash
   # On Windows:
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate

   # On Mac/Linux:
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
   
   💡 **You'll see (.venv) at the start of your command prompt when activated**

3. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Step 3: Run the Weather Analysis

**Basic usage** (downloads weather data for all Canadian locations):
```bash
python src/weather.py
```

**Custom folders** (if you want to organize files differently):
```bash
python src/weather.py --weather-folder weather --results-folder outputs
```

**Performance testing** (see how fast it runs):
```bash
python src/weather.py --benchmark
```

|--------|---------|-------------|
| **hour** | 14 | Hour of day (0-23, where 14 = 2 PM) |
| **bin** | "(-23.6, -20.8]" | Temperature range in °C |

| **temp_mean** | -22.2 | Average temperature in this bin (°C) |
| **count_hours_in_bin** | 45 | Total hours with heating/cooling needed |
| **count_hour_spring** | 12 | Hours in spring (Mar-May) |
| **count_hour_summer** | 0 | Hours in summer (Jun-Aug) |
| **count_hour_fall** | 18 | Hours in fall (Sep-Nov) |
| **count_hour_winter** | 15 | Hours in winter (Dec-Feb) |
| **city** | Calgary | Weather station location |
| **state-prov** | AB | Province/territory code |

### 🧮 How to Use the Results

**Example: Sizing a Heat Pump for Calgary**

1. **Open** `results/hdh_sc2.csv` in Excel
2. **Filter** for Calgary: `city = Calgary`
3. **Find peak demand**: Look for highest `degree_hour` values
4. **Check operating hours**: Use `count_hour_winter` to see winter operation
5. **Size equipment**: Total degree hours ÷ design temperature difference = heating capacity needed

**Practical Engineering Application**:
```
If Calgary shows 2,500 degree hours at -20°C bin:
- Design indoor temperature: 20°C
- Temperature difference: 20°C - (-20°C) = 40°C
- Required capacity: 2,500 ÷ 40 = 62.5 kW-hours of heating needed
```

**Problem**: `python: command not found`
```bash
# Try python3 instead
python3 src/weather.py
```

**Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'`
```bash
# Make sure virtual environment is activated and packages installed
source .venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Problem**: Download errors or timeouts
```bash
# Run again - the tool will skip already downloaded files
